					## What I will talk about
					* What is copyright? What's a license?
					* Open Source licenses in use.
					* Their issues.
					* Choosing one.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Copyright
					* Berne Convention.
					* A bit of text, some code, a drawing.
					* Instant copyright!
					* (Registration not required.)
					* Expression of an idea and not the idea itself.
					* Copyright expires.		
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## You have the right...
					* to paaaarty
					* to copy
					* to not copy (but there's fair-use)
					* to sue (statutory damages)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Who owns the code?
					## You!
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## But...
					* You're contracting / freelancing.
					* You're fulltime and your contract says otherwise.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Licenses
					* Permissions granted to others.
					* Without assigning the copyright to them.
					* You can dual license.
					* Proprietary licenses.
					* Free software licenses.
					* Open Source licenses.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					![License breakdown](images/breakdown.png)
					
					License breakdown on Github, as of 2015. On other sites GPL is still the king.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					![License evolution](images/growth.png)
				
					License evolution on Github, as of 2015.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## No license
					* You have no right.
					* Even if it's on Github.
					* No license is not public domain.
					* Public domain is tricky.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					![Unlicensed repositories](images/unlicensed.png)
			
					Licensed projects on Github, as of 2015.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Licenses
					### Copyleft
					#### (Viral)
					### Permissive
					#### (non copyleft)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Copyleft
					### Are like the borg, they assimilate.
					## Permissive
					### Not the borg.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL
					### The most used
					#### (and known)
					* Created by Richard Stallman for GNU.
					* Version 2 and 3 are used.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL
					#### In a nutshell:
					* If you distribute / sell a product that uses GPL code, you need to provide the source and it needs to be GPL.
					* Private use is fine.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL
					* Version 2: Liberty or death
					* Version 3: Tivoization, patents.
					* "Version 2 or later".
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL
					* Web frameworks
					* Selling themes / Plugins
					* Usage in SaaS products
					* Static / dynamic linking
					* Appstores
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL
					* Wordpress, Drupal are GPL.
					* Hosting your website is not distributing.
					* Contracting means, however, that you're writing GPL code.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL
					* Selling plugins or themes is ok, but they're GPL.
					* The consensus is that you're being payed for customizations and support.
					* Generally images and stylesheets are not considered GPL.
					* None of this has been proven in a court of law.
					* Bridging is sometimes ok.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL
					* When GPL 2 was written there was no SaaS.
					* This was a problem for some.
					* AGPL fixed it.
					* GPL 3 avoided it.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL
					* Linking to GPL code means that your code must be GPL.
					* LGPL was created to avoid that.
					* Key: dynamic linking.
					* Until iOS 8 you couldn't dynamically link.
					* Libraries moved to another license.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Appstores
					* "To make a copy for your neighbour" conflicts with DRM.
					* Mac, iOS App Store are a no no.
					* Android, Linux appstores are fine.
					* VLC was pulled off initially.
					* Dual license (like MySQL did).
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL 3
					### Is compatible with:
					* GPL 2 (if "or later" is used)
					* LGPL, AGPL, Apache 2.0, *BSD, MPL, MIT.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GPL 3
					### Is not compatible with:
					* GPL 2
					* AGPL 1, Apache 1.x, APSL, Original BSD, MPL 1.1
					
					[More on GNU compatible licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses).
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## BSD, MIT, ISC
					* On the other side of the spectrum.
					* Pretty much do what you want.
					* Nothing about patents.
					* Nothing about trademarks.
					* Simple language.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## MPL
					* In the middle.
					* Allows proprietary use.
					* Result can be under a proprietary license.
					* Can be part of closed source software.
					* MPL code must be made available.
					* Patents, trademarks.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Apache
					* Do what you want.
					* Preserve copyright, license, notices.
					* State changes made.
					* Patents, trademarks.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Fair Source
					* Tries to monetize OSS.
					* More than 15 employees: pay.
					* Difficult to integrate with other licenses.
					* Sourcegraph, Codenvy, Data Duck, GitLab.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Public domain
					* Public domain is tricky.
					* Some lawyers say you can't put things in the public domain.
					* Some say you can via a 'dedication'.
					* This is difficult in EU due to 'moral rights'.
					* sqlite
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Unlicense
					* Tries to put code in the public domain via a license.
					* Doesn't quite work due to 'moral rights'.
					* Don't use it.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## WTFPL
					* Do what the fuck you want to license.
					* Don't use it.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Creative Commons
					* Books, music, photos, blog posts etc.
					* Not recommended for code.
					* CC0 is the equivalent of Unlicense.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Which one to choose?
					* It really depends on your project.
					* MIT, Apache 2.0, GPLv3
					
					[choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Other things
					* Watch for simple licenses with extra things.
					* e.g. react's PATENTS file.
					* Stack Overflow's content is CC, migrating to MIT.
					* You probably violated the license.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# So you've started an FOSS project
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Contributions come.
					### Project grows, gains traction.
					### You have 100 contributors.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## And then...
					* You decide to change or add another license.
					* You want to sue someone.
					* You are getting sued because somebody contributed "bad" code.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## So...
					* You have to get approval from 100 people.
					* You have to involve anyone in the lawsuit.
					* You are getting sued for someone else's mistake.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Contributor License Agreement
					* Copyright gets transferred to you / your organization.
					* Can protect you from getting sued.
					* Moral rights rears it's head.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## VLC
					* Moved from GPL to LGPL.
					* French, so moral and patrimonial rights.
					* libVLC: 150 devs, 80,000 locs.
					* Plugins: 300 devs, 300,000 locs.
